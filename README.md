## Number 1:

- Using your preferred programming language, create a simple program that will do the following: - (10 points) Create a base/parent class called `Book` with class attributes like `title`, `author`, `ISBN`, and a method `getDetails()` that returns book information. - (20 points) Create two derived classes:
  `PrintedBook` (with an additional attribute such as number of pages) - `EBook` (with attributes such as file format and file size) - Each derived class should override `getDetails()` to include its specific information.

- (20 points) Apply proper encapsulation (getter/setter methods, public/private modifiers)

- (20 points) Apply proper encapsulation (getter/setter methods, public/private modifiers)

- Create an array containing 1 `Book`, 1 `PrintedBook`, and 1 `EBook`. Then create a loop that will call each instance’s `getDetails()` method. Attach a screenshot of the console output.
